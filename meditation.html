<h2><span style='font-size:30px;'>&#9734;</span> Mental benefits of Meditation</h2>
Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind.During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process may result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit both your emotional well-being and your overall health.And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry you more calmly through your day and may help you manage symptoms of certain medical conditions.

<h3>Quick guided meditation</h3>
Guided meditation is a state of relaxed concentration invoked and led by another party. It can be a yoga instructor, a religious guide, a CD or even a recording of yourself playing back to you. The guide will instruct you to relax specific muscles in the body until they are comfortable, and will then lead you through mental images and visualizations, often of healing light or the dissipation of past wrongs. Guided meditation can be as short as a few minutes or as long as several hours. Either way, the purpose is to achieve mental, emotional and physical healing and stress relief.

<h3>Guided breathing exercises</h3>
Deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body. This is because when you breathe deeply, it sends a message to your brain to calm down and relax. The brain then sends this message to your body. Those things that happen when you are stressed, such as increased heart rate, fast breathing, and high blood pressure, all decrease as you breathe deeply to relax.

<h3>Music of the nature</h3>
“Just feel the magic in the air and the power in the breeze, feel the energy of the plants, the bushes and trees, let yourself be surrounded by nature at its best, calm yourself, focus and let magic do the rest.”
– Sally Walker
